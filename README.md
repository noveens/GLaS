# How to run
- Launch jupyter notebook
- Open and run `glas_test.ipynb`

# Code organization
- `EURLex-4K`: Data directory. All data is downloaded from the [XML Repository](http://manikvarma.org/downloads/XC/XMLRepository.html).
- `logs`: Training logs. This GitHub repository contains training logs for various model combinations on EURLex-4K.
- `utils.py`: Data loader. Contains code relevant for reading data from files, and making batches.
- `glas_test.ipynb`: Main code. Contains all code for GLaS.

# Requirements
- pytorch
- tqdm
- scipy
- xclib (for evaluation) ([LINK](https://github.com/kunaldahiya/pyxclib))
